Pingenator - a super ping tool to get you places

Copyright 2021 Michael D Labriola <veggiemike@sourceruckus.org>

Licensed under the GPLv3. See the file COPYING for details. 

Pingenator's primary use-case is checking internet connectivity by
pinging a list of hosts.  The pinging is done in parallel, so you can
ping a dozen hosts once and have the results in 1 second instead of
12.
