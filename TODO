* fix configure.ac FIXMEs
Specifically, the python version required.

* validate IPADDR arguments
And potentially resolve them to check for duplicates.  The downside to
resolving them is that then the raw IPs will be listed in ping output even if
the user supplied hostnames.

I actually *like* being able to specify the same IP multiple times in some
cases (e.g., ping one host 10 times all at once), so I don't think "duplicate
checking" is a good idea.
