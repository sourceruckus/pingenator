* validate IPADDR arguments
And potentially resolve them to check for duplicates.  The downside to
resolving them is that then the raw IPs will be listed in ping output even if
the user supplied hostnames.

* configure check for ping -w and -c
Do we need to check ping for existence of -c and -w?  I suppose we should...
does busybox ping support both?

* random sleep in sigint_handler
Let's try adding a random, sub-second sleep in the sigint_handler as an attempt
to keep ping summary statistics output by the subprocesses from being
interleaved.  Could also do .1s incrementing global counter for subprocs.

Actually, we need slightly better than this... the subprocs and main proc are
all racing to sys.exit()... once one of them gets there, you don't get any more
output.  Pretty sure that's what I'm seeing when testing -c0 with more than 3
IPs (I don't get all the stats, just the first 2 usually).
