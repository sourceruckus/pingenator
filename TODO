* add some safety check to --count
If we don't do any checking, this could accidentally turn into a fork bomb...
--dns --count=100 for example is going to spawn 1000 ping processess at the
same time.  Perhaps add num_cpus*10 limit overridable via a --force argument.

* validate IPADDR arguments
And potentially resolve them to check for duplicates.  The downside to
resolving them is that then the raw IPs will be listed in ping output even if
the user supplied hostnames.

* -w1 vs -c1 -w1 vs -c1 -W1
I've historically used -w1 to check reachability in a script, but I have seen 2
pings come back once in a while on a system under load.  I assume this is
because the 1 second timeout gets scheduled late, on the order of 1.25 seconds,
and in that extra .25 seconds a 2nd ping is send and received.

I normally wouldn't care... but if we're doing all kinds of calculations based
on the assumption that each process sends exactly 1 ping, we should probably
make sure that's the reality.

Not really sure I understant the difference between -w and -W

* actually finish build system
We've got some sedding to do, perhaps some tool checking via configure.ac
(e.g., python3, ping, ip).  Do we need to check ping for existence of -c and
-w?  I suppose we should...  does busybox ping support both?

Currently not using anything that requires Python >= 3.7 because my initial
development was on Ubuntu 18.04.
